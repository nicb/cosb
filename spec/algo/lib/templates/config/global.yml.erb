# The <tt>global configuration</tt> concerns all the global parameters that
# are required while creating a csound spatialization score. That is:
#
#  * sampling rate
#  * ksmps
#  * number of audio sources required
#  * number of simultaneous movements required
#  * number of point sources per wide volume object
#
#  The +default+ file is the file loaded if no other file is specified

global:
  sample_rate: <%= globs.sample_rate %>
  ksmps:       <%= globs.ksmps %>
  audio_sources:           1
  simultaneous_movements:  1
  points_per_w_object:     2
  sound_speed:             <%= globs.sound_speed %> # meters/sec
